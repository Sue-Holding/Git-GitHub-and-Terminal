<font color="pink"># Git, GitHub and Terminal - Research Uppgift</font>

This is my first ReadMe file to my *first* project creating and opening a file from a *terminal*

As you can see I am learning how to use **Markdown** which might become easier than **HTML**.

I have learnt and feel more familiar with using many different terminal commands for Git now, for example;

> ## Git Commands
> - **git add .** *to save files*
> - **git commit** *to commit my file to GIT*
> - **git status** *to check the status so far*
> - **git branch** *with new branch name to create a new branch* 
> - **git switch** *with the name of branch to switch to*

To name but just a few that I have learned from our teachers.

**Markdown** basic syntax I found from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
