# Git, GitHub and Terminal - Research Uppgift

This is my first ReadMe file to my *first* project creating and opening a file from a *terminal*.

As you can see I am learning how to use **Markdown** which seems easier than **HTML** for a simple content file, but I think I will prefer using **HTML** so I can style better using **CSS**. All knowledge of this I have gained over the summer from reading [mdn wed docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web).

Here are some Terminal commonads that I have learnt during the course so far this week;

> ## Terminal Commands
> - **pwd** *to create current place in work directory*
> - **ls** *to see a list of file content*
> - **la -la** *to see a full list, includinh any hidden files, like .git for example*
> - **cd** *to change folder/directory*
> - **mkdir** *to make a new folder/directory*
> - **echo *"example text"* > test.file** *to create a new file with some text and name it*

I have learnt and feel more familiar with using many different terminal commands for Git now, for example;

> ## Git Commands
> - **git add .** *to save files*
> - **git commit** *to commit my file to GIT*
> - **git status** *to check the status so far*
> - **git branch** *with new branch name to create a new branch* 
> - **git switch** *with the name of branch to switch to*
> - **git init** *to initiat the creation of a git folder including the .git directory*
> - **git log** *to show amongst other data including the SHA1 id*
> - **git ls-tree *SHA1 id*** *to show the blobs and SHA1 id for each*
> - **gt cat-file blob *SHA1 id*** *to show the file content/text contained within that blob*

To name but just a few that I have learned from our teachers.

**Markdown** basic syntax I found from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Here I have attached a file, a photo of me and my family recently on holiday this summer.
